Here are four important complex queries you can create in your *online cab reservation system* using the Star Schema. These queries demonstrate the value of the system by extracting insightful information from the data.

### *1. Query: Total Revenue Generated by Each Driver*
This query calculates the total revenue generated by each driver across all reservations.

#### *SQL:*
```sql
SELECT 
    d.DriverName, 
    SUM(f.FareAmount) AS TotalRevenue
FROM 
    FactReservation f
JOIN 
    DimensionDriver d ON f.DriverID = d.DriverID
GROUP BY 
    d.DriverName
ORDER BY 
    TotalRevenue DESC;
```

#### *Explanation:*
- *JOIN:* Combines the FactReservation table with DimensionDriver on the DriverID column.
- *SUM:* Aggregates the FareAmount for each driver.
- *GROUP BY:* Groups the result by DriverName, calculating the total revenue for each driver.
- *ORDER BY:* Sorts the results by the total revenue in descending order to show the highest earning drivers first.

This query helps to *analyze driver performance* and *determine the most profitable drivers*.

### *2. Query: Number of Reservations per Month*
This query retrieves the number of reservations made each month to track booking trends.

#### *SQL:*
```sql
SELECT 
    d.Month, 
    COUNT(f.ReservationID) AS TotalReservations
FROM 
    FactReservation f
JOIN 
    DimensionDate d ON f.DateID = d.DateID
GROUP BY 
    d.Month
ORDER BY 
    d.Month;
```

#### *Explanation:*
- *JOIN:* Connects the FactReservation table with the DimensionDate table on the DateID column.
- *COUNT:* Counts the total number of reservations (ReservationID) for each month.
- *GROUP BY:* Groups the results by month, providing the number of reservations per month.
- *ORDER BY:* Sorts the result by the month for chronological representation.

This query allows the business to *identify peak booking months* and helps in *seasonal demand planning*.

### *3. Query: Average Trip Duration and Fare by Cab Type*
This query calculates the average duration and fare for trips based on the cab type (e.g., Sedan, SUV).

#### *SQL:*
```sql
SELECT 
    c.CabType, 
    AVG(f.Duration) AS AverageTripDuration, 
    AVG(f.FareAmount) AS AverageFare
FROM 
    FactReservation f
JOIN 
    DimensionCab c ON f.CabID = c.CabID
GROUP BY 
    c.CabType
ORDER BY 
    AverageTripDuration;
```

#### *Explanation:*
- *JOIN:* Links the FactReservation table with DimensionCab on the CabID.
- *AVG:* Calculates the average trip duration and average fare for each cab type.
- *GROUP BY:* Groups the results by cab type to compare the metrics.
- *ORDER BY:* Orders the results by AverageTripDuration, showing the cab type with the shortest trips first.

This query helps assess *which cab types have longer trips* and *whether premium cabs generate higher fares per trip*.

---

### *4. Query: Most Popular Pickup and Dropoff Locations*
This query finds the most popular pickup and dropoff locations, helping to understand demand across different areas.

#### *SQL:*
```sql
SELECT 
    l1.LocationName AS PickupLocation, 
    l2.LocationName AS DropoffLocation, 
    COUNT(f.ReservationID) AS NumberOfTrips
FROM 
    FactReservation f
JOIN 
    DimensionLocation l1 ON f.PickupLocationID = l1.LocationID
JOIN 
    DimensionLocation l2 ON f.DropoffLocationID = l2.LocationID
GROUP BY 
    l1.LocationName, l2.LocationName
ORDER BY 
    NumberOfTrips DESC;
```


#### *Explanation:*
- *JOIN:* This query joins the FactReservation table with DimensionLocation twice: once for the pickup location and once for the dropoff location.
- *COUNT:* Counts the number of trips (ReservationID) for each combination of pickup and dropoff locations.
- *GROUP BY:* Groups the results by pickup and dropoff locations.
- *ORDER BY:* Sorts the results by the number of trips in descending order, showing the most popular routes first.

This query helps the business *identify high-demand locations* and can aid in *strategic driver deployment* and *pricing optimization*.

### *Summary of Benefits:*
1. *Driver performance* can be analyzed by tracking the total revenue earned.
2. *Booking trends* help to plan for demand and understand customer behavior.
3. *Cab type analysis* helps understand fare and duration differences across vehicle types.
4. *Popular routes* help in planning efficient routes and resource allocation.

These queries will showcase the power of your systemâ€™s Star Schema and its ability to derive valuable business insights.
